                <ul>
                    <li>Readings do not constitute professional, medical, legal, financial, psychological, or any other form of advice</li>
                    <li>The App makes no claims of supernatural ability, psychic power, or predictive accuracy</li>
                    <li>You should not rely on any reading or transmission from the App to make real-life decisions</li>
                    <li>For any real-life concerns, please consult a qualified professional in the relevant field</li>

                <h2>2. AI-Generated Content</h2>
                <p>Certain features of the App use artificial intelligence provided by third-party services (specifically, Groq Inc.) to generate readings. By using these features:</p>

                    <li>You acknowledge that responses are generated by AI and may be inaccurate, unexpected, or nonsensical</li>
                    <li>You understand that your questions are sent to Groq's servers to generate a response, and you consent to this data transmission</li>
                    <li>You agree not to submit any sensitive personal information (such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, financial details, or medical information) in your questions</li>
                    <li>We do not store, log, or retain your questions or the AI-generated responses</li>
                </ul>
