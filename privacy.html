                <p>Ollin Tuner ("the App") is developed and operated by Joel Int ("we", "us", "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how data is handled when you use our App.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The App does not require account creation, login, or any form of registration.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party AI Service (Groq)</h2>

                <p>The App uses an AI service provided by <strong>Groq Inc.</strong> to generate readings. When you use the reading feature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The text of your question is sent to Groq's servers (<a href="https://groq.com" target="_blank">groq.com</a>) for processing</li>
                    <li>Groq processes the question and returns a generated reading</li>
                    <li>We do not store, log, or retain your questions or the AI-generated responses on our servers</li>
                    <li>Your questions are not associated with any personal identifier by us</li>
                    <li>The App requests your consent before sending any data to Groq for the first time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Groq may process and temporarily store your question text on their servers in accordance with their policies. For full details on how Groq handles data, see <a href="https://groq.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Groq's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>We recommend that you do not include any sensitive personal information (names, addresses, financial details, medical information) in your questions.</strong></p>

                <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
                <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading count (stored in Keychain for persistence)</li>
                    <li>Purchase status and app preferences (stored in UserDefaults)</li>
                    <li>Daily usage counts for reading limits (stored in UserDefaults)</li>
                    <li>Tutorial and onboarding completion flags (stored in UserDefaults)</li>
                    <li>AI consent preference (stored in UserDefaults)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.</p>

                <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
                <p>The App uses Apple's iCloud Key-Value Store to sync reading counters across your devices. This data is managed entirely by Apple and governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not have access to your iCloud data.</p>

                <h2>Google AdMob</h2>
                <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect the following data for the purpose of serving and measuring ads:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device identifiers (such as IDFA, when permitted)</li>
                    <li>IP address (used for approximate location and ad serving)</li>
                    <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
                    <li>Device and usage information (device model, OS version, app usage patterns)</li>
                    <li>Cookies and similar technologies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is collected directly by Google's SDK and is not accessible to us. Premium users who purchase the Unlimited Access upgrade are not shown any ads, and AdMob data collection ceases for those users.</p>
                <p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">Google's advertising data usage</a>.</p>

                <h2>SKAdNetwork</h2>
                <p>The App includes Apple's SKAdNetwork identifiers for privacy-preserving ad attribution. This allows ad networks to measure campaign performance without revealing your personal information. This is managed entirely by Apple at the operating system level.</p>

                <h2>Apple StoreKit</h2>
                <p>In-app purchases are processed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or financial data. Purchases are governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Ollin Tuner is rated for ages 4 and up. All readings are positive, encouraging, and family-friendly. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The App does not include any features that require personal data input beyond the question text, which is not stored by us.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We do not retain any user data on our servers. All locally stored data on your device can be removed by deleting the App. Reading counts stored in Keychain may persist after App deletion and can be cleared through your device's settings.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data for us to provide, modify, or delete. To manage data collected by Google AdMob, you can adjust your device's ad tracking settings or opt out through <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">Google's Ad Settings</a>.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
